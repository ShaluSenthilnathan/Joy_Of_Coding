/*
Letâ€™s guess: Mr. Int in the evening plays with his small kid Mr. Short Int. Mr. Int puts 10 folded 
chits having numbers 1 to 10 in front of his son. Mr. Short int jumbles those chits and ask his 
dad to pick a particular number say, 9. How many attempts will Mr. Int take? 
Enhance the program for a case where in there may be duplicate chits. in such cases Mr. Int 
should pick all chits having that particular number.
